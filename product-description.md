## Product Description
This release contains the provisional counts for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths in the United States, by week, age, state, sex and place, based on the data submitted to the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and recorded by the National Vital Statistics System. It can take several weeks for death records to be submitted, processed and tabulated by NCHS, so the included data may be incomplete, especially for more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks will continue to be revised as more information becomes available.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides free and open access to various health related data. 

#### Data Sources

`data_as_of, group, state, indicator, start_week, end_week, covid_deaths, total_deaths, percent_expected_deaths, pneumonia_deaths, pneumonia_and_covid_deaths, all_influenza_deaths_j09_j11, pneumonia_influenza_and_covid_19_deaths, footnote`
